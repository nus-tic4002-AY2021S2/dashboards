<panel  header="**1. :fas-info-circle: 💡Quick guide to adding checkstyle with gradle**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S2/forum/issues/93" expanded>

Hello! 

Thought to share a quick guide for the use of `checkstyle` since there has been quite a number of issues surrounding it. Hopefully this also serves as a sort of checklist in case some steps might have been missed out in setting up checkstyle! :)

**Disclaimer: You might want to make a copy of your current project first. These steps worked for me though I have only tested them on MacOS and while I do not believe they will cause issues, it's better to err on the side of caution :3 Additionally,  This quick guide provides the key steps to setting up checkstyle but the full tutorial can be found [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/checkstyle.html). Steps are below!**

1. Head over to the root of your project and create the directories as follow:
```
./config/checkstyle/
```
2. Within the newly created `./config/checkstyle/` folder, place both `checkstyle.xml` and `suppressions.xml` files which can be retrieved [here](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/config/checkstyle).
3. Within your `build.gradle` file, ensure checkstyle is included as shown below:
```
plugins {
    // previously added plugins
    id 'checkstyle'
}

checkstyle {
    toolVersion = '8.29'
}
```
4. Reload your project and the following command should work:
```
gradlew checkstyleMain checkstyleTest
```
**Extra:**

The current `checkstyle.xml` file does not check for capitalisation of constant names for private attributes even though the coding standard requires that to be the case. This can be updated in line **107** of `checkstyle.xml` by changing the boolean of the property as shown below:

**Before**
```
<property name="applyToPrivate" value="false"/>
```
**After**
```
<property name="applyToPrivate" value="true"/>
```

Hope this helps :D

Hello!

I would like to highlight the following discrepancies between the checkstyle file and java coding standard:

1) Screaming snake case not enforced for private attributes in checkstyle file.

2) Javadocs header comments not enforced for getters, setters and constructors.

I am under the impression the java coding standard takes precedence over the checkstyle file so it might be best to manually check for the above until the discrepancies are sorted out :D

<panel  header="**3. :fas-info-circle: 💡Creating JAR file if your app uses third-party libraries**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S2/forum/issues/40" expanded>

Hello!

I struggled a bit creating the JAR file with third-party libraries for tag `A-Jar` as a fat JAR file is needed to solve dependency issues as highlighted in this [guide](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/jar.html), so I thought to just share some steps that might help anyone else using third-party libraries as well.

**Disclaimer: You might want to make a copy of your current project first. These steps worked for me though I have only tested them on MacOS and while I do not believe they will cause issues, it's better to err on the side of caution :3 Steps are below!**

1) The guide recommends the use of [gradle](https://gradle.org/) for creating a fat JAR file (in fact, peeking into week 4 project would reveal the need to eventually follow scenario 2 of the guide). Under all of our forked repos, there (thankfully) already exist a branch called add-gradle-support. Fetch the branch and track it:
```
git fetch origin add-gradle-support  
git checkout --track origin/add-gradle-support
```
2) Check that the `add-gradle-support` branch exist then switch over to your master and merge the new branch in:
```
git branch
git checkout master
git merge add-gradle-support
```
3) If you do not see a `build.gradle` file now appearing in the root of your project, close and reopen your project then open up the `build.gradle` file. Under `dependencies` section in the file, add your third-party library. For example, using the [json-simple](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.googlecode.json-simple/json-simple/1.1.1) library, the `dependencies` section would look as such (notice the additional first line):
```
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.googlecode.json-simple:json-simple:1.1.1'
    testImplementation group: 'org.junit.jupiter', name: 'junit-jupiter-api', version: '5.5.0'
    testRuntimeOnly group: 'org.junit.jupiter', name: 'junit-jupiter-engine', version: '5.5.0'
}
```
4) Next, under the `application` section of the file, edit `mainClassName` to match that of your main class (Duke if you have been using that name all the time). If you did the `A-Packages` tag, this will need to match your package name as well. For example, if your java files sit under the package `com.example.app` with the main class Duke, your `mainClassName` in the `build.gradle` file will look as such:
```
application {
    mainClassName = "com.example.app.Duke"
}
```
5) Finally, run the following command in the root of your project on the terminal:
```
./gradlew shadowJar
```
6) From the root of your project directory, you will find the new JAR file within the `./build/libs` folder which you can then run with the `java -jar` command.

I hope this serves as a good reference but please raise up any mistakes I may have made! Thanks :D

<panel  header="**5. :fas-info-circle: No commit message on auto-merge after resolving merge conflicts**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S2/forum/issues/30" expanded>

Hello,

I was working on increment Level-7 and Level-8 in their respective branches. After finishing both of them, I forced git to create a merge commit using the `--no-ff` flag as shown below:
```
git merge --no-ff branch-Level-7
```
This worked for merging Level-7 with my master but merging Level-8 raised up merge conflicts with the following message:
```
java_projects/ip$ git merge --no-ff branch-Level-8
Auto-merging src/main/java/Command.java
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in src/main/java/Command.java
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```
I thus went ahead to resolve the conflicts, add and commit the files within the master branch (kindly advice if this is the correct branch to resolve conflicts on). After committing the modified files and running the merge command again, I was greeted instead with an `Already up to date` message. Pushing the commits however, did not create a commit message despite me specifying the `--no-ff` flag earlier. Is this expected behaviour?

Edit: Added screenshot of the commit history on my master branch in case the explanation above was not clear enough :3

Hello!

For git commit messages, I have noticed an inconsistency between an [example given](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s2.github.io/website/schedule/week2/topics.html#W2-3) in the week 2 topics and the [SE education guide](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/git.html), the latter which I just learned about. For clarity sake, the styles shown in the above 2 links are as below.

*Example in week 2 topics:*
<img width="802" alt="Screenshot 2021-01-19 at 11 18 11 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43908963/104983621-12884e00-5a48-11eb-857c-2a855d2031fb.png">

My past commits have all been done following the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), which is more inline with the first example above (the notable difference is the capitalisation of the first word in the commit message). Moving forward, may I know which modes of commit styles are allowed and should the case be that the first word must be capitalised, does that mean I have to update all past commit messages? ;-;

<panel  header="**7. :fas-info-circle: Clarification on fixing previous levels/tags**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S2/forum/issues/13" expanded>

Hello,

I would like to clarify if we are required to revisit old tags and fix issues that we might have overlooked. In particular, running runtest.sh for `A-TextUiTesting` threw the following error for me despite passing the test:

<img width="531" alt="Screenshot 2021-01-18 at 2 43 47 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43908963/104852634-17a9a800-5937-11eb-9f54-ef682a67c22b.png">

The error is thrown because I had used a while true loop instead of checking for nextLine in the scanner to take inputs thus far. As I am unaware of how the automated grading scripts work for the previous levels (or rather what they look out for), I am concerned that the previous levels might be affected by the while true loop implementation when ran against the scripts. At the same time, I have also realised that it is impossible to commit to those previous tags which means updating them individually would be quite a hassle.

I would really appreciate advice on this, thank you!

Hello,

I would like to clarify if there is a need for us to concern ourselves with whether repeated task names are allowed/disallowed. Without checking for repeated task names, it would mean the following scenario is possible:

<img width="309" alt="repeated_task_names" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43908963/104815821-f0c57600-5851-11eb-901f-2a905142dd5b.png">

If repeated task names are allowed, then a follow-up question would be is there a need to distinguish them uniquely when tasks are marked as done (this affects implementation).

Kindly advice, thank you!

Hello! Just to add on to what @w2vgd said above, the reason for the version incompatibility is due to [github deprecating their password authentication](https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-02-14-deprecating-password-auth/). For anyone facing a similar issue on SourceTree, [this thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63615535/sourcetree-error-logon-failed-use-ctrlc-to-cancel-basic-credential-prompt) also contains relevant information.

Hello!

The split function in java allows a second parameter called limit, which is the threshold for the number of elements obtained in the result.

For example:
```
String str = "Hello there, nice to meet you!";
String[] parsedStr = str.split(" ", 2);
```
In the above example, parsedStr will contain these 2 elements:
```
{"Hello", "there, nice to meet you!"}
```

Hope this helps! :)

Hello Prof @damithc!

Thank you for the response. I am slightly confused by your second statement. The technique taught in the SE-edu guide seems to enforce capitalisation of the first word in the commit message whereas the convention does not. Wouldn't this mean they do not sit well with each other? In fact, the education guide and convention are both contradicting each other so if the former is always the same for every project, wouldn't it mean the latter is never followed? Sorry for the many questions, thank you again for answering!

Edit: Do I have to update past commit messages to adhere to the SE-edu guidelines or is it alright to just do it for future commits? :3

I am not entirely familiar with windows but have you tried running the command as administrator? If you are able to do so, then there is likely a permission issue and you might want to check the ownership for the affected files/folders. Otherwise, this [article](https://windowsreport.com/administrator-access-denied-windows-10/) contains quite a number of options that you might want to explore.

If all else fails and it's convenient for you, it would be good to list some of the options you tried so that someone more competent can come along to help. Sorry I couldn't do much ;-;

From what I can see in the screenshot, you are running the command from `C:\WINDOWS\system32`. The paths specified in both the runtest.sh and runtest.bat files however, use relative paths from the `test-ui-test` directory of the project (notice the presence of .. which refers to the parent directory of where you are executing your command). Try running the command inside the `test-ui-test` directory and see if it works :)
</panel>

<panel  header="**21 :fas-comment:**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S2/forum/issues/23#issuecomment-763372122" expanded>

I think it was not explicitly said in the instructions to run the scripts within the `test-ui-test` directory. That said, `..` does not actually refer to `test-ui-test`, rather, it refers to the parent directory of wherever you were running your command from. When you originally ran the command from `C:\WINDOWS\system32`, `..` would have brought you up one directory to WINDOWS. When ran from the `test-ui-test` folder, `..\src\main\java\*.java` first moves up one directory to iP (project folder), then it looks for `src` which it can find in the project folder, then `main`, `java` and finally all the java files inside the java folder.

When you see relative paths specified, it is almost certain you need to run the script from a specific directory (otherwise it is likely you will not be able to find some of the files). At this point you might think why not just use absolute paths, but keeping paths relative does make the program more portable (it's plug and play most of the time). Both have their pros and cons, hope this clarifies :D

@colintkn To add on, you may also consider using the scanner method `hasNextLine()` in your loop condition. In that way, regardless of the input, your loop will only continue if it detects that there are subsequent inputs, thereby eliminating the `NoSuchElementException` you are getting.

Based on what Prof Damith said [here](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S2/forum/issues/24#issuecomment-764187044), I think the tags are for us to measure our own progress. My own branches weren't error free when I pushed them but I tagged them anyways :3

Hi @kangtinglee, JUnit comes with these 2 annotations:
```
@BeforeEach
@AfterEach
```
As their names suggest, methods with these annotations are executed before and after each test and I believe that would be where your setup (and teardown) code goes. I am however interested to know if there are any other practices as well :)

I have yet to construct unit test for such fields and I do agree it seems quite meaningless xD However, should there be a situation where there is a need to ensure the description is correct, I would likely construct a test case as below within the DummyTest class:

```
@Test
void checkDescription_whenInputDescription_thenDescriptionMatch() {
    String expected = "This is a dummy class.";
    Dummy dummy = new Dummy();
    assertEquals(expected, dummy.DESCRIPTION);

> Just want to extend the discussion a little bit: normally we would have a lot of such static final field declarations in our application, then managing the 'expectations' would be quite troublesome already. I guess there would be some place/some way for us to manage what would be expected for the (important) static fields easily (e.g. instead of peeking at individual classes), but I have no clue : |. Anyone knows anything about it?

I agree it's going to be huge hassle with lots of static final field declarations. Off the top of my head, I imagine for larger applications with lots of static final field declarations of string types, these strings may be stored/read from inside a `messages.yml` or `messages.json` file of sorts (has the added benefit of easy configuration/changing messages without directly editing the file containing code). It might then be possible to construct a single test class pertaining to all these messages which should at least centralise the testing and makes things slightly more organised. What do you think?

@gycc7253 You might need to check if the parent directory for your file actually exist before attempting to create it. For example, if you were creating a file as below, the data directory might not be present yet:
```
File file = new File("./data/tasks.txt");
```
In which case, you may need an extra line of code after that to create the data directory:
```
file.getParentFile().mkdirs();

Out of curiosity, I compiled the project with nothing marked as root and randomly marking a file as root. Turns out even though IntelliJ flagged out problems for the latter, compilation of the project still worked in all cases and the JAR file runs perfectly fine. I did notice that the editor has some useful labels (for example parameter names) that only appear when you have the `Sources Root` set correctly. Otherwise, just from this small tinkering around it does seem like setting the root is more of an enhancement.

From the first line of the instruction, it says to create the folder `[project_name]\src\test\java\`. This would imply the java folder is supposed to be created manually which you have already done. I did not actually change anything inside the test.iml file although more on what the file is about is explained [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/creating-and-managing-modules.html).

@rajobasu By external file do you mean other java files within the same package? I imagine static variables in these files would then be referred to through their class names so maybe something like `Dummy.staticVariableHere` (static methods would also be referenced similarly).

@rajobasu Both [JSON](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_json.asp) and [YAML](https://circleci.com/blog/what-is-yaml-a-beginner-s-guide/) are file formats for storing data. You are right to say they will have to be loaded and these are usually done through third-party libraries which differ across programming languages. For JSON in java, we have the likes of [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) and [json-simple](https://code.google.com/archive/p/json-simple/). These libraries provide means for us to load in the data from those files which we can then assign to `static final` variables. Hope that clarifies :D

Edit: Exception handling will need to be done for reading/writing from `.json` and `.yml` files but is handled within the code. The files themselves just hold the information. I am not actually sure this is the best way to do things but there is the benefit of consolidating messages within a file and modifying them without having to touch the codebase directly.

@rajobasu That's a really great point. I have been theory-crafting up till this point and am honestly unsure of how file contents can be specifically loaded into `static final` variables. I did a quick google search and you are right about the approach with initialisation class/codes. As to why they would not feel ideal, could you share more? I imagine even if this doesn't work well for messages, would it still at least work well for a configuration file?

Edit: I think it might be possible to group constants of a similar nature together instead of by class (for example messages pertaining to information). I am not sure what associated dangers there may be because any sensitive information should not be stored in plain text to begin with. Are there any dangers I am overlooking?

Ahhh... I think I am starting to get how the `.iml` files work (I hope 😅). Just throwing out a hypothesis but it seems the `&gt;sourceFolder>` tag specifies which modules the `.iml` file applies to. It should then technically be possible for a single `.iml` file to apply to multiple modules in a project (hence the multiple `&gt;sourceFolder>` tag in your original `ip.iml`). Should that be true, it might be that `ip.iml` was taking priority (for whatever reason) over your `test.iml` file, hence triggering the error you saw. I am guessing it would also work if you copy the contents for `JUnit` from the `test.iml` file into `ip.iml` file but since it's working now I guess it's good xD

For a void method I think it depends on what the method itself achieves. I had a similar situation where my void methods were merely printing outputs and this [guide](https://www.baeldung.com/java-testing-system-out-println) here proved very helpful. In another scenario, it is possible that a void method alters a particular attribute of an object and in that case, I believe checking if the attribute was altered successfully would suffice. For these cases, the `@BeforeEach` and `@AfterEach` annotations would come in useful.

From the shell, can you check if there is a `src` folder in the same directory as where your Kelbot.jar is? If there is, check if there is a `main` folder within the `src` folder. Finally, check if there is a `data` folder within the `main` folder. If any of the three folders are not present, your code responsible for creating the folders is likely not working as intended.

So I just double checked and I have a data folder created at `./out/artifacts/ip_jar/data` for my case where I stored my data file in `./data/tasks.json`. I believe your code will need to ensure that `./src/main/data` is created at where your jar file is sitting. Give it a try and see if that works :D

Edit: Consider adapting and playing around with the following:
```
File file = new File("./data/tasks.json");
file.getParentFile().mkdirs();

The use of double `..` will bring you two directories up to the `out` folder but I am unsure how this will help with your case :sweat_smile: Since you are getting an access denied error, try running the cmd prompt as an administrator. If this works, you can check your folder/file permissions :)

I suggest working with a simple `./data/Kelbot.txt` for now (which means a data folder at where your jar file is and the text file will be created within it). Access denied does sound like a separate problem which will require you to check read/write permissions but take it step by step and see if you are able to run the jar file as administrator from the cmd prompt first :)

When running the code directly in Intellij, the file is created with respect to the root directory of `ip` (`./data/Kelbot.txt` in this case would mean having a data folder in the same place as where your `src` folder is). When you build it as a jar and run it with `java -jar` instead, the file is now created with respect to the jar file. At least that's how I understand/have observed it (I hope I have not been rambling on wrongly ;-;). But stick with `./` and see if it works out. If access denied still pops up, try running as administrator in cmd prompt and see if that helps too :D

Essentially yup! You have 2 different `data/Kelbot.txt` (one from directly in IntelliJ, one from running as jar). In fact you can move the jar file to elsewhere on your computer and the new data folder will take reference from wherever you moved it too.

I am not sure if this is actually relevant to the error you are facing (although with your current structure, copy pasting the `.iml` files without modifications will likely fail). Nonetheless, if you are willing to do a minor restructure on your project, you can consider the following:

1) Instead of marking the `src` folder as your `Sources Root`, mark the `java` folder within your `main` folder as your `Sources Root` (this does mean you need to change your package statements in your java files). 

2) Then, you may follow this [guide](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/junit.html) which essentially brings you through replicating the folder structure under `test` folder to mirror that of the `main` folder (your test classes need to be created in a matching package). You would then end up with a structure similar to this:
```
src
  - main
    - java (Sources Root)
      - duke
        - *.java 
  - test
    - java (Test Sources Root)
      - duke
        - *.java 
```
It's a bit neater to see both `main` and `test` folders mirroring each other and the `.iml` file you referred to earlier should fit nicely with this structure as well. See if this actually helps with your issue, otherwise you might want to share your test class as well :D

The screenshots are a bit blurry so I cannot see all the import errors but a point to note is that once you mark the `java` folder within the `main` folder as `Sources Root`, you need to change your `package` statements for all your java files to be `package duke;` as `java` would not be part of the package name.

For your ParserTest.java, once the project is structured correctly, you may refer to option 1 of point 8 in this [guide](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/junit.html).

I am not sure why there is an error arising from marking roots but you may consider unmarking all of them first then re-marking them again. Hopefully these will help resolve some of your above issues.

You might want to try unmarking your `src` folder as `Sources Root` and then marking the `java` folder within your `main` folder as `Sources Root` first. Then, check if the directory structure in your `java` file in the `main` folder mirrors that of the `java` file inside your `test` folder. You shouldn't have to explicitly import `Duke` in your test class. Use `Duke` in the test class as you would normally in the main class and a prompt would pop up for you again to rectify the error. See if any of the above helps :D

From the point of a user, I believe the second option is more intuitive and friendly. I would probably appreciate it more if every successful operation is saved such that a random crash later on won't affect all previous operations xD

Edit: On a relevant note, the discussion can also be taken further to discuss how saving/loading is done. For every operation, do you write to the file and then read from it again to repopulate/update the array list of task that you have, or do you have another piece of code to modify the already loaded array list of task? 

I think with the current size of the program and a task limit of 100, this would not matter but scalability wise, if the number of tasks start growing significantly, then it might get expensive to keep reading/writing all tasks from the file.

> 1. Save a Task
> 2. Delete the storage file

I think this would be handled as an IOException within the method responsible for saving tasks. Ideally the code should re-generate the missing folders/file if they are found to not exist but upon a failed creation (maybe due to permission issues), it should terminate the entire program with a proper exit message.

> If I were to re-generate missing file structures, then I would also need to consider adding previously existing tasks in the list to the file as well, otherwise, there will be a mismatch between what is in the file vs what is in the task list at run-time. This could cause problems as well if the user modifies a task added before the file was re-generated (e.g. mark a task as done in the application, and this task is present in memory but not present in the file on the user's hard drive).

Now that you say this I didn't actually consider re-generating the file with previously existing tasks even though that sounds like a best case scenario for the user - more patch up to do :'DDD

Correct me if I am wrong but I felt the tutorial used `Main` and `Duke` interchangeably a couple of times in the third tutorial. In one of the steps they said `Main` class but their example was showing that of `Duke`. For the fragment of code you showed in your first post, I believe you might get something if you add `stage.show()` right after `stage.setScene()`. If it is convenient and you would like to you can give it a try. Otherwise if the issue is already resolved that's great too :D

Hello! Check [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/checkstyle.html) for the checkstyle tutorial and retrieve the files [here](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/config/checkstyle). Place both `checkstyle.xml` and `suppressions.xml` within `./config/checkstyle/` :)

I bumped into this yesterday while working on part 4 of javafx tutorial. I googled a bit about it but didn't read too much into it except javafx did seem to have a hand in the 'InvocationTargetException' :P As far as I can recall I think it "wraps" itself around other exceptions (in your case that would be 'NullPointerException) but if you click on the other exception through the bottom left panel in your screenshot, you should be able to get the stacktrace for the underlying error :D

Double check your `checkstyle.xml` and `suppressions.yml` are correctly retrieved from [here](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/config/checkstyle). This thread [here](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S2/forum/issues/70) has a similar issue and it seems to be related to the checkstyle file contents.

Edit: Also check your `build.gradle` file as well :)

> im wondering whether should i save it as .yml? because the previous post you mentioned suppressions.yml rather than .xml in github

Please keep it as `.xml`, it was a genuine mistake and I have edited the reply 😅 Do you mind sharing how you added checkstyle in your build.gradle?

Alright just to eliminate the possibilities, your checkstyle and suppressions files are placed similar to this?

Is the capitalisation for instance level final variables strictly not allowed? The example provided in coding standard for a non-static `final` variable is as below:

I think you are using a third-party test plugin because my dependencies section back while adding JUnit looked only like this:
```
dependencies {

    testRuntimeOnly group: 'org.junit.jupiter', name: 'junit-jupiter-engine', version: '5.5.0'

Assuming you are using scenebuilder, you may want to go to `label` within `DialogBox.fxml` file. In the right panel, go under `layout` and check if it has min, max and pref width/height set to something like this (by default it should all be computed):

new Image(this.getClass().getResourceAsStream("/images/Duke.png"));

If you took the checkstyle file from AB3 directly then to be very honest I am not sure as well since the file contents I had were also from AB3 😅. Perhaps it has to do with the way it was retrieved (I copied the raw contents of the file, didn't actually download it).

In your `Launcher.java`, are you calling `Main` or `Duke`? I suppose with your current structure, it should be calling the `Main` class like this:
```
Application.launch(Main.class, args);
```
In this case, your `Main` class would be the one extending `Application` instead of your `Duke` class.

Edit: You don't need to write an `init` method :) You will however want to extend `Application` in `Main` instead of `Duke`. To elaborate a bit more, the top level of my package contains the 3 classes `Launcher`, `Main` and `Duke`. `Launcher` is the entry point and calls the `Main` class which extends `Application`. Within the `Main` class, the `start` method is overridden and the `Duke` class is called from `Main` class.

If you are using gradle then the compilation should be done with `gradlew build` or `gradlew clean shadowJar` depending on which tutorial you followed. If you are using `javac` I believe third party dependencies need to be specified with the `-cp` flag.

I have issues locating your `Launcher` class in the branch you provided (is it not committed and pushed yet?) but if you are calling `Duke` directly from `Launcher`, then you need to refactor your `Duke` class to not take in any arguments in its constructor.

On a side note, your repository has a number of `.class` files that are likely a product of the `javac` command. You might want to clean those up first by going to `src/main/java/duke/` and typing `rm *.class`. The folders in this directory mostly contain `.class` files as well so you might want to clean them up as you deem fit given that your `java` files all sit in the same package.

To be honest I did not face this issue because my `Duke` class never took any parameters in the first place xD So after you asked, I just dug a bit deeper and it turns out arguments are allowed to be passed, but they are specified in a particular way and requires the import of `javafx.application.Application.Parameters;`. There is a specific syntax for passing and retrieving the arguments which are neatly outlined [here](https://java-programming-fall-19.mooc.now.sh/part-13/4-launch-parameters) if you wish to explore :D

I am not using `@ParameterizedTest` myself so I am not too familiar but for a start you might want to standardise the JUnit versions specified in your dependencies first (perhaps to 5.5.0). After which try reloading/reopening your project and see if `@ParameterizedTest` would be recognised :)

If you are getting this error I assume you are on part 4 of the tutorial. In which case. there is a need to refactor the `getUserDialog` method to take in `String` in the parameter instead because the code in part 3 of the tutorial actually implemented `Label` as parameter.

Edit: A couple of other fields are affected as well such as `Image` and `ImageView`. A quick look at the codes from both part 3 and part 4 of the tutorial should reflect the parts that need refactoring :)

Not sure if this will be helpful but if you are able to pull up command logs within sourcetree, looking at the commands executed might yield some details (the equivalent of `history` on the command line)

Edit: Just theorising here. Based on pure observation alone, in the line `Fix coding violations pointed out by peers`, there was a 3-branch split into assertions (green), codequality (red) and what appears to be a pseudo master (yellow). Perhaps github/sourcetree have some underlying implementations for pull requests resulting in this yellow branch but I am just making wild guesses at this point. Moving on, my guess of the flow is that assertions (green) branch was first completed and merged into your actual master (blue). A merge was then performed automatically to the pseudo master (yellow) to keep the branch updated. The codequality (red) branch then merges the new commits from the pseudo master (yellow) before merging itself to the actual master (blue).

It seems checkstyle is the reason you are failing the build, though what I have for the checkstyle section in my `build.gradle` file is simply the following (without the need for `configFile`):

checkstyle {

Googling the error returns quite a number of [results ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47509287/run-javafx-jar-as-sudo-unable-to-open-display) that seem to lean the issue heavily towards permissions/dependencies, though they seem to occur mostly on `ubuntu`. That said for your `MainWindow.fxml` file, `fx:controller="MainWindow"` needs to reflect the path to where your `MainWindow.java` file is sitting at. So in your case it would look like `fx:controller="dbot.gui.controller.MainWindow"`. Hopefully it brings you closer to a solution :D

Hi, I have a few queries about the coding standards/discrepancies with checkstyle that I will like to clarify.

2. Should we make all instance variables that will not be modified `final`? An example is shown below in which these instance attributes are not modified after the constructor. If they are indeed supposed to be marked as `final`, then they are supposed to be capitalized too right?

Hello, 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65358857/106261434-87376580-625c-11eb-988c-b4ee1cc1d1ed.png)

In the class diagram shown, from what I can gather,
- Each `Foo` object is connected to 2 other instances of `Foo` objects
- Each `Foo` object has 0 or more `Foo` objects stored with the variable name `bar`

What I think how the sample code for `Foo` looks like is:
```
class Foo {
    Foo f1;
    Foo f2;   // I am assuming that f2 cannot be the same instance as f1
    Foo bar;  // bar can be the same instance of Foo as f1 or f2
}
```

However, in the video, it is mentioned that option b is correct even though the bottom 2 instances of `Foo` are connected to only 1 other instance of `Foo`. I would think that option b is only correct if the bottom 2 instances of `Foo` are connected to each other (or some other instances). Can someone help clarify if I am wrong in my understanding? Thank you.

<panel  header="**5. :fas-info-circle: Regarding empty catch clause**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S2/forum/issues/59" expanded>

Hi, may I ask if the java convention disallow empty catch clauses? 

In my use case below, I am allowing users to pass in multiple date/time formats, for e.g. 23/1/2021 1800 and just 23/1/2021. Thus, I created an enum `InputDateFormat` that specifies different date/time formats (also, is the use of an enum here appropriate?). Then when I try to parse the user input date string, I use a for loop to loop through all the date/time formats (the enums values) and attempt to parse them into a `LocalDateTime` object. If the first attempt fails, I catch the exception and continue the for loop to attempt to parse again.

Is this a valid way to use empty catch clauses? Or should I re-implement this design in another way? (Or does anyone have any suggestions on how we can handle multiple date/time formats?)

Tip on how to add/remove past tags from both the remote repo (github) and your local repo through the command line:
`git push --delete origin &gt;tag_name>` : removes the tag from the remote repo (github)
`git tag --delete &gt;tag_name>` : removes the tag from your own local repo
`git tag -a &gt;tag_name> &gt;commit_SHA1_hash>` : to manually tag a commit (as compared to `git tag -a &gt;tag_name>` which tags the latest commit only). Note that the SHA1 hash of a commit is a 40-character hash that is computed every time you make a commit, and also you only need to specify around the first 8 of the characters of the hash

An example of the SHA1 hash:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65358857/105580274-65eef900-5dc6-11eb-926a-0a8428996d81.png)
(An example tag command could therefore be `git tag -a Level-8 c0b35c1a`)

Do note that deleting tag in either the remote or local repo does not remove the tag in the other. You have to run both the commands to remove a tag completely from both remote and local repo if you want.

I believe you can add ".gitignore" inside the _.gitignore_ file itself to ignore it (if the _.gitignore_ file has never been commited before). 
However, if the _.gitignore_ file has already been tracked previously, it will still show up in git status. One way to solve this can be to add the ignores to _.git/info/exclude_ in the repository instead. 
(Refer to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10176875/add-gitignore-to-gitignore#:~:text=gitignore%20file's%20purpose%20is%20to,be%20included%20in%20the%20repository for more information)

As an aside, regarding the iP, I believe we should still commit the _.gitignore_ file actually.

Hi Prof, thanks for the clarification. There seems to be a workaround (using chcp 65001) but it involves the end users changing their system configuration.

You can double check if the JDK location is correct (without any other subfolders behind the jdk-11.0.6). You may also try rebooting your IntelliJ/computer after ensuring the JDK location is correct.

Did you manually push the tags to your remote repository? Tags are not pushed to the remote repository by default. You can try running the command `git push origin --tags` to push all your tags to the remote repository.

> Hi! I think that as for this week's tasks it would not be of a great difference to choose either one of the two. However, personally, I prefer to create an object of Duke instead of making its methods and variables static.
> 
> Besides the vry good reasons mentioned by @kormingsoon, my answer would add on more from the perspective of OOP practice. If we use static methods/variables in Duke, it means that the states of Duke can be affected by all the instances of the class. Thus the Duke class is not in complete control of its own states, and those static methods can be seen as methods at a global stage. As a result, the principle of encapsulation is not well followed here and it results in more coupling between components.
> 
> Thus, personally I think creating a Duke object would be better.

I think this is a very good point raised by @richardcom, as static methods/fields can be accessed by all instances of the class. 
Below is what I think but I am not very sure if my logic/understanding is accurate though. (Please feel free to correct me if I am wrong!) 

What if this chatbot is to be used by multiple users at once? Then the likely scenario is that there will be multiple threads that each create a new instance of the Duke chatbot to engage with the user. However, with static methods/fields, all of the different instances of Duke chatbot will be accessing the same field. 

Take for example, if we have a static attribute `static List&gt;Task> taskList = new ArrayList&gt;>();` and static methods `addTask(Task task)` and `printAllTasks()`. Then when user A and user B each add a task to their own instance of chatbot and proceed to print their tasks respectively, each user will be able to see both taskA (task that user A added) and taskB (task that user B added) inside their list!!! 

Therefore, I think making the methods and attributes belong to the instance of the class will make more sense in this case.

> Alternatively, we may make use of the `.next()` from the `Scanner` object you have created. It automatically takes in the next String in the input, which is the command word in our case. Then, based on the command, we can carry out relevant steps, for example a `.nextLine()` to read in the rest of the line.
> 
> However, I do agreee with @tjtanjin that his way of splitting may be more elegent during implementation:) Hope it helps in providing another perspective.

Used this method mentioned by @litone01 as well. However, one thing to note is that if you use `.next()` to scan for the command first, and proceed to use `.nextLine()` to scan for the remaining string immediately, then the test script _input.txt_ should end with a newline character as the method `.nextLine()` is blocking. For e.g. the _input.txt_ file should be something like

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65358857/104986292-b6282d00-5a4d-11eb-830d-b5f36f6d5c52.png)
(where the last empty line in the file simulates the user pressing "enter/return" keyboard button)

Without the last empty line, and if `.next()` is immediately followed by `.nextLine()`, the command would not be executed as the `.nextLine()` call would be blocking to wait for an input that is not there. A workaround without the last empty line may to be check the whether the command is "bye" right after the `.next()` method, and not calling `.nextLine()` if the command is indeed "bye". But I do not think this is a good way to code our program.


However, I do agree that the `.split(regex, limit)` method provided by @tjtanjin is much more cleaner and simpler! Didn't think of this previously. May want to update my code accordingly too 😅

I do not think that using enums for exceptions is wrong by any means, but I do agree that using enums for exceptions does not seem to be the best choice. An enum cannot extend any other class, and in particular, it cannot extend the Exception class (or Throwable class), which means that it will not be able to inherit any methods/fields of the Exception/Throwable classes (and also you won't be able to use the `throw` keyword too). You will have to implement them yourself if you choose to create a standalone enum.

Hi @tjtanjin, I believe what you have now is already correct. The latest commit shown in the screenshot above (with hash 83e2ae5) is the result of the merge between the `master` branch (which was already merged with the `branch-Level-7` branch previously) and the branch `branch-Level-8`. 

> ```
> java_projects/ip$ git merge --no-ff branch-Level-8
> Auto-merging src/main/java/Command.java
> CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in src/main/java/Command.java
> Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
> ```

When you run this command which attempts to merge `branch-Level-8` with branch `master`, there is a merge conflict and you went on to modify the files and probably ran `git add` (which marks the file as resolved), followed by `git commit` (which actually finalizes the merge conflict, i.e. commits it). 


> I thus went ahead to resolve the conflicts, add and commit the files within the master branch (kindly advice if this is the correct branch to resolve conflicts on). After committing the modified files and running the merge command again, I was greeted instead with an `Already up to date` message. Pushing the commits however, did not create a commit message despite me specifying the `--no-ff` flag earlier. Is this expected behaviour?

Therefore, when you run the `git merge` command again, the system prompts you that it is already up to date because the `master` branch is already merged with the `branch-Level-8` branch. I believe after this you do a `git push` command to push the changes from your local repo to your remote repo and hence you have 4 commits as shown.
The 4 commits are correct from the steps you took, with their messages originating from:
1. The commit message from committing in `branch-Level-7`
2. The commit message from  committing in `branch-Level-8`
3. The commit message from merging branch `branch-Level-7` with `master`
4. The commit message from merging branch `branch-Level-8` with `master` (you probably wrote "Fix: fix merge conflicts" when you finalize the merge command with `git commit` as explained above)

Thanks @litone01 for sharing, and maybe I can add on by sharing how to add/remove past tags from both github and your local repo through the command line.
`git push --delete origin &gt;tag_name>` : removes the tag from the remote repo (github)
`git tag --delete &gt;tag_name>` : removes the tag from your own local repo
`git tag -a &gt;tag_name> &gt;commit_SHA1_hash>` : to manually tag a commit (as compared to `git tag -a &gt;tag_name>` which tags the latest commit only). Note that the SHA1 hash of a commit is a 40-character hash that is computed every time you make a commit, and also you only need to specify around the first 8 of the characters of the hash
An example:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65358857/105580274-65eef900-5dc6-11eb-926a-0a8428996d81.png)
(an example tag command could be `git tag -a Level-8 c0b35c1a`)

Do note that deleting tag in either the remote or local repo does not remove the tag in the other. You have to run both the commands to remove a tag completely from both remote and local repo if you want.

> Ahhh... I think I am starting to get how the `.iml` files work (I hope 😅). Just throwing out a hypothesis but it seems the `&gt;sourceFolder>` tag specifies which modules the `.iml` file applies to. It should then technically be possible for a single `.iml` file to apply to multiple modules in a project (hence the multiple `&gt;sourceFolder>` tag in your original `ip.iml`). Should that be true, it might be that `ip.iml` was taking priority (for whatever reason) over your `test.iml` file, hence triggering the error you saw. I am guessing it would also work if you copy the contents for `JUnit` from the `test.iml` file into `ip.iml` file but since it's working now I guess it's good xD

I have noted that a `LocalDateTime` object has to have both a date and time field, so when the user pass in only a date format, e.g. `LocalDateTime.parse("23/1/2021", DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("d/M/y"))` actually returns an error. In this case, my original for loop will fail too. 

Therefore, I have decided to parse the date and time strings separately and use both a `LocalDate` instance attribute and a `LocalTime`  instance attribute in my `DeadlineTask` class to describe the full date and time. Am thinking if just using a simple split method over using regex to parse the input date and time will be better in this case.

1. static imports
2. standard java imports (imports from standard java api, e.g. `import java.util.Scanner`, `java.time.LocalDate`, etc)

It seems weird that you have a `main.iml` file in addition to the `ip.iml` file. When did the `main.iml` file get created? Can you try deleting the `main.iml` file and check the contents of your `ip.iml` file?
You may want to compare it to my `ip.iml` file, and take a look at the highlighted line (which is different from yours)

> @w2vgd I managed to get rid of the warnings by digging the checkstyle.xml and comment out the code block for MemberName (line 120). But I'm not sure if that's allowed.

Hi @figo2127, just my personal opinion but I would think its best not to comment out that part since it serves to check if all of your member variables are named correctly (those that are non-final too). Although the check is kind of simple as I seen from the regex, i.e. only making sure that the variable name starts with a lowercase and that the name only consist of letters and digits, I think that it may still be useful as a final safety check (given that we have quite a number of files to check, and even more so for tP later on). 

As such, I have reverted to using camelCase for static non-final member variables to comply with the checkstyle rules (because I can't stand the warnings generated by checkstyle 😅).

Hint 1: For the greeting message, think about how similar it is to your current messages, i.e. what kind of node are you using to display the current messages now and also how are you adding them to your application now. After that, think about the sequence of event that happens when you boot up your application, i.e. the lifecyle of a JavaFX application (I have attached an image below for your reference). Think about when/where you can add that node to your current window :)

Hint 2: For the bye message, think about where you can add an additional check for the command passed in by the user. Can the check be done in `handleUserInput` or should it be done in `getResponse`? What method can you call to exit the program if the command is actually an exit/bye command?

Does your test folder directly mirror the original main folder? In this case, for example, is your structure for your `Duke` class in the `main` folder as follows:
`main` -&gt; `java` -&gt; `duke` -&gt; `Duke.java` ?
and similarly for your `Event` and `Todo` classes. They have to be in the exact same folder structure as the `main` folder.

Hi, I think that the "Trailing Whitespace" error is not caused by the blank lines, but rather it is caused by literally trailing white spaces in the specific line. 

For example, this does not give any checkstyle violations:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65358857/107137249-ab263580-6945-11eb-84d1-66a9a812cd67.png)

While this gives the "Trailing Whitespace" checkstyle violation:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65358857/107137257-cabd5e00-6945-11eb-81f2-9d3c1d2ea571.png)
(Notice the extra whitespace at the end of line 42?)

All you have to do is to go to the line as indicated by the checkstyle violation, and remove all the whitespaces that are at the end of the line. 
Or a faster method is actually to right click your java folder, and click `Reformat Code`.

Hope this helps 😄

Additional tip: 
For people who feel that its annoying to have all formats of `todo` marked as a TODO item (which will fill up your TODO list with unwanted tasks), what I did was to go to `Settings` -&gt; `Editor` -&gt; `TODO` and format the patterns manually (or you can even delete it). I ticked the case sensitive checkbox and specify the pattern to be all uppercase letters so that only when i type `TODO` then it will be marked as a legitimate todo item as shown in the image below:

In addition to comparing just the advantages either streams or loops bring, I think its also worthwhile to look into the disadvantages and also perhaps some "inconveniences" that each brings. I find this [stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44180101/in-java-what-are-the-advantages-of-streams-over-loops) summarizing the advantages/disadvantages quite succinctly. There seems to be a common consensus that loops are much easier to read as many have mentioned above. 

> But I was wondering from the industry standpoint, would software engineers tend to be more comfortable with loops or streams? Is there some kind of industry preference out there if any of you guys have an internship experience.

In particular, the "Familiarity" portion of the answer from the stackoverflow post mentioned that since streams are not available in every language and is a relatively newer concept, I guess loops are generally considered more comfortable for many.

But of course it still depends on each programmer in the end. And also while working in a team or on a brownfield project, I guess you will still have to follow what others use so that the style of coding is consistent throughout?

Do note that you should not use use `AssertionError` or `assert` statements to handle invalid user input. Imagine if the user accidentally pass in a command "appl" and then the program crashes because of a small typo, I think that the user will be quite shocked to say the least. The program cannot recover from an assertion error because throwing an assertion error will mean that something has gone horribly wrong in the code at this point and any further execution may likely result in unwanted consequences. 

As what @candyhy has mentioned, you should use exceptions to handle invalid user input and propagate that exception to be handled by the caller parent method instead. There is also nothing wrong with adding that the method throws some exceptions in the method signature too. This is to help you ensure that any method who calls this method will have to handle this exception.

If you want to match ``` “\x” ``` where ```’\’``` is not an escape character, it should be written as ```”\\\\”```. First, Strings treat ```”\\”``` as a single ```”\”```, and so does regex, so we kind-of have to do it twice.

Hi Prof, 
That is my understanding as well. But in that case, doesn't "building a new feature fully" mean completing a full component and thus is an example of depth-first ?

@marcusleeeugene using enums for exceptions are probably a bad choice (?!), instead those should be ExceptionClasses themselves, like InvalidIntegerException, or EmptyDescriptionException, if you so want it to be!

Um, I have a question that how do you exactly define ```static final``` variables from an external file? The only way I can think of is using constructs like 
```
class A{
    static {
    
    }
}
```

However, is this a good way to do this? What if the thing fails? Exception handling will be hard as well since you have to do everything mostly in these places, so not that modular right? 

Just want to know what the best practices are for these things.

No I mean, how you were talking about keeping static constants in a ```.json``` or something. You will have to load them right?

Yea I know about JSON/json loaders but the thing is that where will you put the code for that? since it’s a static final variable, needs to be in static blocks right? But then, assuming all classes usually have some static constants, you can’t really instantiate anything in that case right due to circular logic. So you would end up having to put a lot of the initialisation code inside the static blocks, which don’t feel ideal to me. Agreed that there is a benefit of keeping constants at the same place, but do you even really want that? 

Think about it from another perspective :  not all constants are ```public``` (and in general most aren't). Putting them in the same place can be dangerous. Secondly, if you want to keep separate files for the constants in different class, might as well just hardcode them. 
Atleast these came to my mind!

By the way, is the following true?
- check only methods which are returning something — ie very modular. 
- if method is not functional, then it means it is a series of steps which should be clear from the method name itself so why test? If there is additional computation, maybe just shift it to other methods and repeat step 1.

You might also want to look at try-with-resources, which basically closes ```AutoClosable``` objects automatically. 
Second, @georgepwhuang mentioned about garbage collectors, related to that is the ```finalize()``` method as well. 
It is called just before the object is to be garbage collected. However there is a caveat here. Look at the following code: 

```
Class A {
    static A ref = null;
    static boolean x = false;  
    public void finalize() {
        if(x) {
            
              // close some stuff ( —— line (1) )
            return;
        }
        A.ref = this;
        A.x = true;
    }
    public static void main(String… args) {
        A a = new A();
        a = null;
        // force garbage collector, lets say (even though you can’t do it, but just for argument) to garbage collect the object.
        a = A.ref;
        A.ref = null;
        // again force gc.
    }
}
```

You would assume that the line(1) would be called atleast once right?
Turns out no!!!

The first time the object is garbage collected, we forcefully keep a reference. So it is not garbage collected.
The second time, that garbage collector **doesn’t call finalize()** at all! 
It’s only called the first time the object is about to be garbage collected. ONLY THEN.
As a corollary, I also showed how after calling finalize, the garbage collection might get botched altogether!

I believe that in this specific scenario, there are two things we can essentially do: 
 - As OP mentioned, we can leave it as a blank catch since it doesn’t make sense to do anything with the exception. Indeed, upon some digging this might also be the Oracle recommended way? Look at [this](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/datetime/iso/format.html) article, seems like there is no testParse() function available anyway, the main way to deal with this error is throwing an exception. 
 - Second, which I think is better albeit tedious, is to fix the input to a particular format and then regex it yourself before making a LocalDateTime from it, since throwing Exceptions is a very costly thing to do in a program just like that. 

In general, Exceptions are supposed to deal with **exceptional** situations, which is not so in this case obviously. Hence, they in general should be dealt with by a non-empty code block.

objects have a function called ```.equals()```.
You need to override that in your object. Right now they only match the memory location of the object which is obviously different since these are two different objects.

There are two perspectives to this problem I feel: 
- From a user standpoint, saving every change is obviously optimal. I feel we should give the user a choice to save only when pressing save, or save automatically (as is the case in many applications). 
- Is it fast if there is a lot of changes? 

Well, naivest way to do is every time you load all the tasks in the memory, do wtvr the user asks you to do, and before exiting just save everything to the file. 
- this is bad becoz if user terminates by some other way, all changes are lost. 
- Good becoz it is fast since everything is done in memory

Second way is to do the same thing but read/write again and again everytime a single operation is done
- this is good bcoz robust
- bad becoz VERY slow and nonscalable. 

Next method is in the file, instead of reading/writing everything, save the commands themselves. This will allow you to not write everything, but just append to the end of the file the new commands. Again we can do this in two flavours, either add after every user operation, or add at the end. (or maybe add at certain time intervals — maybe by having a separate Thread for this instead of doing on the main process thread). 
- Robust, user doesn’t lose information
- Writing is fast since we are appending new information instead of rewriting everything.
- Reading is costly becoz we read all operations performed before instead of all tasks. This is not an issue now since per task we can do atmost 3 operations — insert, markAsDone and remove. so #operations = O(#tasks). But this might not be so always. 
- Reading the first time is also costly, but not prohibitively so.

I had a question (a bit tangential from the main post, really sorry for that). I checked @CharlesLee01 ’s code, there are two main methods one inside Duke and one inside Launcher. How does Java determine which main method to call? Secondly how does changing the ```mainClassName``` inside ```build.gradle``` help? If the main method is changed, shouldnt the entire program change? (ie, one was text-based vs one was UI based).

Essentially the thing is to remove everything that uses that particular class/variable whatnot. Safe delete is just deleting all occurences, and you have to manually change the places which uses that particular class/variable.

I think streams also help in writing lesser code? I personally find them very easy to manage.

Access denied does sound like a separate problem which will require you to check read/write permissions but take it step by step and see if you are able to run the jar file as administrator from the cmd prompt first :)

The thing is the file is always created with respect to ip directory, not with respect to wherever the java file/jar file directory is. 
So when I do `..` it actually went out of ip into the parent folder of ip, which is probably the main problem hahahaha

In one of the steps they said `Main` class but their example was showing that of `Duke`. For the fragment of code you showed in your first post, I believe you might get something if you add `stage.show()` right after `stage.setScene()`. If it is convenient and you would like to you can give it a try. Otherwise if the issue is already resolved that's great too :D

Hmm yea in the end I went and did that in Main.class and it worked, that's why I was confused as to why it didn't work in MainWindow

Hi, was trying to do the tutorial (removing a field) for tp code base, just observed sth:

when I do the refactoring (removing the `phone` field of `Person`), the tutorial mentions it is better to [refactor the test data as well so that the old version does not accumulate](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s2.github.io/tp/tutorials/RemovingFields.html#tidying-up).

That part I have no problem with. But then I wonder whether we also need to refactor the json data under `[root]/data/`. According the `.gitignore`, that data file is not version controlled, which means if I delete the `phone` fields in the data file, then I switch to other branches, I would have issues loading data because some compulsory data field is missing.

Then, does it mean I should not edit that data file when refactoring? I understand **in this case** if I do not edit the data file the code would work for my working branches and other branches, but are there any possible implications (which will make refactoring the un-version-controlled data file necessary)?

If there are no such implications, it is clear that I should not refactor the un-version-controlled data file whenever I refactor my code. But I cannot get my logic correct here (either prove or give counter examples). Help needed. :)

When I wrote documentations for the `Todo` item, whenever I mentioned "todo" in documentation intelliJ will automatically mark it (and the text following it) as a TODO comment, which makes my documentation looks quite messy (through intelliJ).

Just sharing it in case you have same feeling as me:
Go to Setting/Preferences (for MacOS) -&gt; Editor -&gt; Color Scheme -&gt; General -&gt; Code -&gt; TODO defaults -&gt; disable the `Error stripe mark`, and disable `foreground` if it has a colored predefined.

Agree with @w2vgd. I used enum for the commands to facilitate printing out a help menu for commands available (just for fun).
However, for the actual functionality side I haven't figured out a very elegant way to integrate enum with commands. Any suggestions?

> I have yet to construct unit test for such fields and I do agree it seems quite meaningless xD However, should there be a situation where there is a need to ensure the description is correct, I would likely construct a test case as below within the DummyTest class:

Agreed. If I am not wrong you are saying there would be cases where there is a need to check whether the description **matches** the expected value, in this case, the String `"This is a dummy class."`. 

Just want to extend the discussion a little bit: normally we would have a lot of such static final field declarations in our application, then managing the 'expectations' would be quite troublesome already. I guess there would be some place/some way for us to manage what would be expected for the (important) static fields easily (e.g. instead of peeking at individual classes), but I have no clue : |. Anyone knows anything about it?

> I agree it's going to be huge hassle with lots of static final field declarations. Off the top of my head, I imagine for larger applications with lots of static final field declarations of string types, these strings may be stored/read from inside a `messages.yml` or `messages.json` file of sorts (has the added benefit of easy configuration/changing messages without directly editing the file containing code). It might then be possible to construct a single test class pertaining to all these messages which should at least centralise the testing and makes things slightly more organised. What do you think?

I used to think of putting important static messages in a doc or something equivelent. But yeah, using a `.json` or `.yml` file as a whole seems to be a much better idea. :D

For styling issues I would say no big difference. For performance issues mentioned above I would say streams can work parallel and can be more efficient compared to for-loop for a very big list of data. (But for small amount of data, yes, loop is usually more efficient.)

**Background:**

I finished doing my parallel branches "branch-A-Assertions" and "branch-A-CodeQuality" for Wk 5 iP. Then I created a PR for ONLY 
"branch-A-Assertions" (my mistake), then merged the PR with the repo. Here is where I realised my mistake, so I followed this [post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6481575/undo-a-merge-by-pull-request) and did these steps to reverse the merge PR.

```
git fetch origin
git checkout origin/master -b revert/CSmortal/branch-A-Assertions
git revert -m 1 61720c8e5aa82d127e8eb6ee17e636e7e515d6b7
```

It's my first time using git fetch, so I'm not sure if `git fetch origin` did anything cuz there was no output when the command finished. After doing `git revert -m 1 61720c8e5aa82d127e8eb6ee17e636e7e515d6b7`, there were many unstaged files (not sure if this the expected behaviour), then I committed them with the commit message "revert merge pull request".

**Problem:**
So now I'm trying to create another PR from my remote's "branch-A-Assertions" to "master", but I get the issue mentioned in the title: 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67994626/108364002-8462db80-7230-11eb-881e-50545e048d82.png)
After some toying around, my guess is that this local branch called "revert/CSmortal/branch-A-Assertions" is in someway equals (i'm not sure) to the remote branch "branch-A-Assertions", which explains the picture above. My question is ...

1.  What is this "revert/CSmortal/branch-A-Assertions" branch? Is it just a local branch thats why I can't see it on my remote repo? What is its relationship with the local and remote "branch-A-Assertions"
2.  What do I do now to create a PR from "branch-A-Assertions" to "master"?

This is how it looks like on my SourceTree right now, if you do need them:

So after learning more on code quality/standards, I was convinced that the default case for switch statements and else clause for if else blocks should almost always be exclusively for throwing exceptions or `assert false`/ `throw new AssertionError()` statements. But this doesn't get around the issue of having to return something from a non-void method. Returning null has always been my go-to until now for convenience sake, so I'm not sure what to do now.

Asking since I don't think I'm exploiting the staging area enough. I don't want to inundate my repo with tons of commits, but git stash reverts my working directory back to the latest commit.

@tjtanjin I tried restructuring the proj the way you mentioned. 

I assume this pic below confirms that "java" under src/main is the source root.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67994626/105957234-ea39c880-60b3-11eb-83cf-f4c9ee42b865.png)


Strangely under the same "Project Structure>Project Settings>Modules" window, "java" under src/test is not marked as test sources root, when I have already done so on the left pane of intellij to mark it as the test sources root, and appears green as well.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67994626/105957292-0473a680-60b4-11eb-9e9d-0846d2312c75.png)

And lastly, the imports are all messed up and idk how to solve it. In Deadline.java, it doesn't know what Task is (like IntelliJ doesnt give me the option to import Task but they belong to the same package anw so why is this happening?), and ParserTest.java under test.java.duke has no option to import the classes in main.java.duke

@tjtanjin changing my package statements for all my java files to `package duke;` still doesn't allow me to import the relevant classes within the same package. 

I just wanna check if I'm marking each directory correctly:

Does this window confirm that the `java` folder within the `main` folder is the source root?
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67994626/106102954-22580e80-617b-11eb-9dbe-21c364440588.png)

 The left pane on IntelliJ isn't very helpful cuz it just shows the whole thing `main.java.duke` without allowing me to right click on `java` to check what it is marked as. So i just resorted to the Project Structure window that comes up after pressing Ctrl + Alt + Shift + S above
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67994626/106103319-ba55f800-617b-11eb-9a72-b2973cae38a5.png)

Also, I'm kinda confused why both `src/test` and `src/test/java` are both test sources roots, after i followed @ypinhsuan instructions. Is this intended? I'm reading up on what modules in IntelliJ are but im rly confused on what they are.

Ah shucks, i forgot that i need to change the package statement for ALL of the java files.

**I no longer have the "No Tests were found" error!**. It seems like the issue was with the coexistence of the `ip` and `main` module, where i believe my `test` module had `ip` as its dependency, which caused issues with making `src/main/java` the source root. 

@w2vgd I created the `main` module after the `ip` module, and then i later deleted the `ip` module.

Cn I ask why exactly if the content root (im assuming this is just the root of a module) of `ip` is `src`, and if I had no `main` module, then why does the error occur (where the `test` module has `ip` module as its dependency)?

@tjtanjin I tried adding `testCompile("org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-params:5.7.0")` to the dependencies section of the build.gradle. Not sure what I had to do next so I went to the relevant java file and tried to see if the tag `@ParameterizedTest` is recognised, still doesnt work.

@chewterence 
for your 1st method that `throws CommandNotFoundException`, what if i didnt want the method to throw any exception, like if i wanted to handle any exceptions in this method, i.e.
```
public Fruit parseCommand(String command) {
    try {
        switch (command) {
        case "apple":
            return new Apple();
        case "banana":
            return new Banana();
        default:
            throw new CommandNotFoundException();
        }
    } catch (Exception ex) {
        // Do something
    }
}  
```

I think this will have compile errors since the "missing return statement" error appears. I'm more certain this appears for if/else blocks instead of switch statement.


As an example of the issue in my code, the situation looks something like this:
```
public Fruit parseCommand(String command) {
    try {
        if (command == "apple") {
            return new Apple();
        } else if (command == "banana") {
            throw new Exception("what is a banana?");
        } else {
            assert false : "You shouldn't reach this block";
        }
    } catch (Exception ex) {
        // Do something
    }
    
    return null;
}
```

In the code above, I'm assuming the command can only be `"apple"` or `"banana"`, so I'm trying to test that assumption with this code here. One else if block doesn't have a return statement, but even if it does, i still get the issue of "missing return statement" if i dont include the `return null` after the try catch block. And for the reason why i put the `assert false` statement in the else block, following [this assertions tutorial in Wk5 topics,](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/language/assert.html) in the Suits example with the part on "Internal Invariants", it says we should test the assumption that the suit variable is one of the four types, so thus we should put a `assert false` statement in the default case of switch statement (and by extension the else block for if else blocks). So, regarding what @kouyk said about assertions "should not be triggered at all if the code is correctly written", I don't think his way should be the approach to writing assertions. Following the link, we should be testing assumptions, not riding on them.

@candyhy I'm not very familiar with throwing and switch statements, but if you're enumerating all your cases ( not using the default case as your last case to handle the last possible input to the switch statement ), unless your method that contains the switch statement explicitly throws something in its method declaration, your default case should cause the "missing return statement" if it does not have a return statement. Please correct me if I'm wrong

> For the oracle tutorial, they are using enums, which should only take on a limited number of values in which all of them should have a switch case, the only time that the assertion occurs is when a new enum value is added but not handled. This is a good scenario to use assertions since it indicates that the code needs to be updated. Furthermore, the switch case does not return, so presumably there will be a happy path below to handle the returning. For your example, you might want to explain the rationale behind asserting and catching that very same assertion when it can be handled all within the same else block. I would assume if the `command` is invalid, a parsing exception should either be raised like for the banana scenario since it is not to be handled by the `parseCommand` method, or there is a default `Fruit` to be returned instead.

@kouyk Ok so assuming its not enums, and each case in the switch statement returns something, then the solution to escape the "missing return statement" should be a happy path, or a default "Fruit" returned in the case of the parseCommand() method? Because the relevant code in my iP doesn't have a happy path (its checking what the input is "==" to, not checking against some boolean condition or smth), and i dont want to return a default object.

@kouyk yup, thats the code I'm having the issue with. So after reading Prof @damithc 's comment, for `Parser::parseRemainder()`, should I be including a `throws Exception` in its method signature, then remove the try catch block in the method, then I will no longer have the "missing return statement" error if i exclude the `return null`?

thanks all, can I also ask when should I use assert statements over throwing AssertionError()? The oracle docs shows AssertionError would be better for those Internal Invariants situations and for the same issue of "missing return statement" error inside a non void method. Coupled with java disabling assertions by default, I can't see when to use simple assert statements.

Hi everyone, I have a question about the IP grading since the deadline is next week. I have a few doubts, and I would like to clarify them now.

1) Regarding the IP requirements: Correct me if I am wrong, but I believe what happens is that the grader(is it script or human?) will click on the tag associated with the particular requirement and grade that branch according to the requirement at that time. As long as the requirement is met,  it counts towards the Implementation component. 

2) What if I implemented something imperfectly at that point in time, but made changes and corrected it much later? I know it is possible to move the tags, but I'm not sure if I should move a Level-2 tag, to, say, after Level-10. 

3) Will the overall submission be looked at, at all? Or rather, what is the role of the overall submission? 

EDIT: 4) Another question I have is, I only just realised that I have not been 100% following the git commit conventions. How will this impact my grading, since more than half of the commit messages are not exactly correct? Specifically, I added a full stop at the end of every commit message subject.

EDIT: 5) One big nagging question is also regarding handling exceptions. Initially before the GUI was added, one could read the exceptions since the app and the exceptions were both shown in the command line. However now with the GUI, the user would not be able to see the error messages, which is a bit unsettling to me, although I am not aware of any requirement to implement this. Am I right to say that handling exceptions as it were is acceptable?

I think I will have more, but these are the ones in my head at the moment. Thank you.

gitignore only prevents files that has not been tracked previously to be ignored from tracking.

As the gitignore file itself has been tracked in the past, the option would not be available and, as above, should continue to be tracked.

The FC command is actually similar to the Unix `diff` command that shows the differences between two files (in this case, the ACTUAL.TXT vs EXPECTED.TXT).

If you try to replace it with the full path of where the executable exists, does it work? (i.e. this is usually found in `C:\Windows\system32\fc.exe`)

Perhaps this would be helpful on Windows 10! Just ensure that the system32 directory is in the Path variable.

From the file path and where you’re running the JAR from, I think the relative path there would imply that your duke.txt file is in: `...\Java\compileroutput\artifacts\ip_jar\src\data\duke.txt`, which I guess is not what you have set up? You can verify this if you create the src\data directory in ip_jar folder.

It looks like the file creation is failing because the src\data directory is not present in ip_jar folder. Which is why if you tried to create the aforementioned folders and it works, then you can implement the fixes that @tjtanjin has suggested :)

Personally, I don't think it's a good idea to commit compiled files unless there is a good reason for doing so. By definition, since git is primarily a version control tool, it makes sense to want to version control the source files instead of the compiled product.

Additionally, I believe you may run into issues with rebasing later on (if you have the need to do it) with the inclusion of compiled files.

Personally, I find that the second option would be good. What if the program crashes or encounters some other unrecoverable error before the save has happened? I think the efficiency of saving/deleting/modifying the file can be called into question as well when you have a larger number of Tasks.

Inadvertently, this does also raise the question of what happens if the user does the following "unsupported" task:
1. Save a Task
2. Delete the storage file
3. Try to save the task again

This will probably be classified as unsupported behavior and not an intended use of the application. However, should we as developers foresee these types of issues and attempt to make provisions for them?

> I think this would be handled as an IOException within the method responsible for saving tasks. Ideally the code should re-generate the missing folders/file if they are found to not exist but upon a failed creation (probably due to permission issues), it should terminate the entire program with a proper exit message.

That's true. I was considering this possibility because the way I implemented my add task function only appends the new task to the end of the opened file. 

If I were to re-generate missing file structures, then I would also need to consider adding previously existing tasks in the list to the file as well, otherwise, there will be a mismatch between what is in the file vs what is in the task list at run-time. This could cause problems as well if the user modifies a task added before the file was re-generated (e.g. mark a task as done in the application, and this task is present in memory but not present in the file on the user's hard drive). 

And there could be various more "unsupported" uses of the application or ways to break it like this that I hadn't really thought about as well.

I feel like think this is very situational and they are good for both scenarios. There are cases where streams are more readable than for/while/if, especially if there are many scenarios to be checked for, and writing a stream and collecting them could look much cleaner and readable. On a personal level, I'd use "traditional" for/while/if for simple checks and use streams if the loops are more complex.

But, it's also subjective. As you have pointed out, some of us are more comfortable with traditional loops as opposed to streams. One requirement may be to have code that's able to be maintained or better understood by others through the course of a project, and it may be necessary to adjust to that. Otherwise, personally, at the end of the day, as long as it gets the job done and conforms to coding standards and quality requirements, from a SE perspective I don't think there's a "right answer" unless there's a specific scenario in which it forces you to use one over the other.

The data in the `data/addressbook.json` is populated by the [sample data utility](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java) if it is not present, so I think if your working data is messed up later you could let it re-populate again later.

Personally, I did not remove the address field in the data file while doing the removing field tutorial since it's not in git and by nature it's fine for JSON files to have extra fields anyway (although maybe in an ideal scenario the software developer would code to remove unused fields in future revisions to patch if they are no longer necessary).

For mine, the config folder was separate from the src folder, but I somehow managed to get it to work. These are the Javadoc checkstyle properties that I kept:

      <property name="scope" value="public"/>

      <property name="allowMissingReturnTag" value="true"/>
      <property name="tokens" value="METHOD_DEF, ANNOTATION_FIELD_DEF"/>
```

Everything else was deleted. Here's the full list of my deleted properties in original order for non-trivial private:
```
<property name="minLineCount" value="3"/>
<property name="allowUndeclaredRTE" value="true"/>
<property name="allowThrowsTagsForSubclasses" value="true"/>
<property name="allowMissingThrowsTags" value="true"/>
<property name="allowMissingPropertyJavadoc" value="true"/>
<property name="ignoreMethodNamesRegex" value="(set.*|get.*)"/>

And for public:
```
<property name="minLineCount" value="1"/>
<property name="allowUndeclaredRTE" value="true"/>
<property name="allowThrowsTagsForSubclasses" value="true"/>
<property name="allowMissingThrowsTags" value="true"/>
<property name="allowMissingPropertyJavadoc" value="true"/>
<property name="ignoreMethodNamesRegex" value="(set.*|get.*)"/>
```

After all these, I managed to get CheckStyle to run on both my main and test code. I'm keeping this issue open in case there's a more elegant solution without deleting these properties.

Hi Prof @damithc, what if we had used enums earlier than the given order? 

In the instructions it states "Implement the following increments in the given order." where the given order was "Level-1, Level-2, Level-3, Level-4, A-TextUiTesting, Level-5, Level-6, A-Enums". However in my case it made sense to use enums before Level-6. In this case does the tag ordering matter?

As I understood it, deadlines should be paired with the "/by"  operator and not the "/at" operator. Hence the need for events. 

In my case for deadlines I specifically ensure that it requires a "/by". If there is no "/by" it should be a todo command instead and hence I also throw an error. So for the case of "deadline return book /at Sunday" I throw an error.

As said by the others, I prefer to use streams in areas where a traditional loop would become visually complex, and I can better hide this complexity through the use of streams. 

From [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44180101/in-java-what-are-the-advantages-of-streams-over-loops) on stack overflow, streams appears visually easier to understand, even in the case a simple loop.

```
**Traditional Loop:**
List<Person> filtered = new ArrayList<>();
 for(Person p : people) {
     if(p.age() < 19) {
         filtered.add(p);
     }
 }
 return filtered;
```

```
**Streams:**
return people
     .filter( p -&gt; p.age() < 19)
     .collect(toList());

```
For the industry, as said by @w2vgd I think it makes sense to gain consensus from existing code in the brownfield project.

I found [this link](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/safe-delete.html#safe_delete_example) from IntelliJ useful for some examples.

Personally when I use safe delete I like to briefly check the safe delete conflict list to see if there are any areas I would not like safe delete to automatically delete something for me. 

If I recall you can right click the specific conflict to exclude it from safe delete. Although tedious, it would help avoid further issues down the line.

So after reading Prof @damithc 's comment, for 'Parser::parseRemainder()', should I be including a 'throws Exception' in its method signature, then remove the try catch block in the method, then I will no longer have the "missing return statement" error if i exclude the 'return null'?

Sounds correct. Also as @w2vgd has said, instead of asserting that the user has input a wrong command. It would be better to throw an exception and handle it. I would have done something similar to this:

''''
public Fruit parseCommand(String command) throws Exception {
    Fruit fruit;

    if (command == "apple") {
       fruit = new Apple();
    } if (command == "pear") {
       fruit = new Pear();
    } else if (command == "banana") {
        throw new Exception("what is a banana?");
    } else {
        // Should not be asserting here as this is a user error. Should throw an exception instead.
        throw new Exception("Invalid command etc");
    }

    return fruit;
}
''''

The oracle docs shows AssertionError would be better for those Internal Invariants situations and for the same issue of "missing return statement" error inside a non void method. Coupled with java disabling assertions by default, I can't see when to use simple assert statements.

I get that, but it seems weird to separate them in my case, since it doesn't seem sensible to implement streams without lambdas, or vice versa. At least in my case, they are tightly intertwined, and belong together in one logical commit. Anyway, thanks for your feedback.

we are supposed to put `Ui.png` under `docs` directory for it to be shown in the [ip showcase page](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s2.github.io/website/admin/ip-showcase.html), but on the ip showcase page I noticed that the webpage is actually trying to fetch the picture from &gt;https://USERNAME.github.io/ip/Ui.png>, which means if the product website is not set up using GitHub pages exactly as instructed, it might not be shown in the ip showcase page.

Do you think it may be better to use &gt;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USERNAME/ip/master/docs/Ui.png> as the url of the picture? Otherwise, maybe it woule be better to state explicitly in the instructions that we need to serve our `Ui.png` at &gt;https://USERNAME.github.io/ip/Ui.png>?

Using an HBox seems to be an interesting solution! I did it in a slightly different way.

I used a `javafx.scene.shape.Rectangle` as the dialog box. To print the message within the Rectangle, I wrapped both the message node and the Rectangle inside a `javafx.scene.layout.StackPane` which resizes automatically so that all its children are within its boundary. However, the Rectangle does not resize automatically. Therefore, what I did was ` rectangleNode.heightProperty().bind(stackPaneNode.heightProperty());` so that the Rectangle's height is always equal to the height of its parent StackPane.

One benefit of this method is that you can easily replace the Rectangle with any other shape (e.g. `javafx.scene.shape.Path`) without changing any other code.

A more complete Java code snippet:

```Java
Rectangle rectangleNode = new Rectangle(300.0, 20.0);
rectangleNode.setFill(Color.AQUA);

StackPane stackPaneNode = new StackPane();
stackPaneNode.getChildren().addAll(rectangleNode, messageNode);

rectangleNode.heightProperty().bind(stackPaneNode .heightProperty());
```

Hi Nicholas! Here is my naive idea. Maybe you could choose to put the relative function into one class to simulate OOP. But I remember that the requirement of iP is to use OOP most. So you could consider changing the structure of your code and add more features about OOP. Hope this helps!

Hi @w2vgd, here is one of the explaination on google. Maybe you could refer to it.

> Java modules are the simplest module type and represent a basic Java application project, whether it's a command-line tool, a Swing application, or a JAR library. When configuring this type of module, you can specify a set of Java source paths that will be compiled to a single class folder. The basic capabilities of this module are carried over into the web module.

> The web module is an extension of the Java module that adds support for web applications. In addition to providing the ability to create and build Java sources, it lets you edit your web application's deployment descriptor, build and deploy it to your application server, and configure other web application capabilities. You create a web module for each web application in your project.

On my own opinion, it seems that it doesn't matter for this project. JAVA_MODULE is enough to satisfy the requirement since WEB_MODULE is an extension of the JAVA_MODULE and we don't need any web applications so far. Hope this works!

Alternatively, we may make use of the `.next()` from the `Scanner` object you have created. It automatically takes in the next String in the input, which is the command word in our case. Then, based on the command, we can carry out relevant steps, for example a `.nextLine()` to read in the rest of the line. 

However, I do agreee with @tjtanjin that his way of splitting may be more elegent during implementation:) Hope it helps in providing another perspective.

Maybe I can share a bit about how to move the tag to the future commits in case anyone is curious. Personally I find it easier to be done via SourceTree. It is essentially just **deleting the old tag and create a new one**:)

1. Click on the commit with the tag you wanted to move. 
2. Right click and click on tag to open the dialog where you created the tag.
3. Click on "remove tag" and select the tag you wish to change. I find it useful to also check the "remove tag for all remotes".

4. After removing the tags, just select the more recent commit and create the tag for it. And then your tag is **'moved'** there!
5. However, do note that these changes may **distort your ordering of tags** when u click on 'tags' page for your forked project on Github. For example, mine looks like this now T_T Even though the commit with tags "A-Enums", "level-2" and "level-4" are older than that for "A-TextUiTesting", these tags are still behind them.

@rajobasu I have the same queries as @nickyfoo. So does it mean we have to manually delete every relevant usage of the "address" in the project code?

Hello, sharing this tip to help format code style in IntelliJ to better fit module java style guidelines.

To configure switch statements:
Go to Settings > Editor > Code Style > Java, select tab "Wrapping and Braces", scroll down the list to 'switch' statement, uncheck the option "Indent 'case' branches".
<img width="659" alt="Screenshot 2021-01-25 at 2 10 00 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70088064/105667845-11a75e80-5f17-11eb-8777-c3a99521b162.png">

Then reformat your code by right clicking on the Java folder and  clicking on Reformat Code.

agree with @w2vgd that it is too hasty to conclude default cases and else clause should be used solely for throwing exceptions/errors. Printing in the default case can help debugging(to affirm that the switch clause is reached) since there can be new cases as we add new features to a software.
Personally, I have used switch clauses in non-void methods, and I find no issue in the return statements as the default clause is never reached. Maybe you can consider handling all cases in the switch clause so the default case will never be reached? Variables can be declared as `Integer count;` instead of `Integer count = null;`

> @candyhy I'm not very familiar with throwing and switch statements, but if you're enumerating all your cases ( not using the default case as your last case to handle the last possible input to the switch statement ), unless your method that contains the switch statement explicitly throws something in its method declaration, your default case should cause the "missing return statement" if it does not have a return statement. Please correct me if I'm wrong

@CSmortal 
If your cases handles all possible enums, and the default case will never be reached, then throwing an assertion error in the default case does not require an exception to be added to the method signature. In my opinion, throwing an assertion error in a default clause that shouldn't be reached makes sense. 

Attached below is an example of use of assertion error in default clause:

However, this scenario only applies when you can list out all possible case values, because assertions are meant to detect flaws in the programmer's code and not because of an invalid user input (this should be handled by exceptions). So as what Prof @damithc and @kouyk has mentioned, you may want to handle the exception in the calling parent method or just handle the issue directly at the place where the issue occurred.

My take is that If an exception is thrown then the lack of a return statement should not matter. So I guess your problem at hand is with assertions. Since assertions are not meant to be recoverable and indicates a bug to be fixed, it should not be triggered at all if the code is correctly written. If it is expected to occur then an exception should have been thrown in order to be caught. Using `assert false` in default case or else blocks is equivalent to not using it since assertions can be disabled. So ideally your code should have a happy path that always returns something valid, assertions are there to help you catch unexpected bugs when assertions are enabled.

The following is extracted from the link you have provided.

Doing a quick check on build.gradle shows that the version of checkstyle we are using is 8.29, so that should explain the error you have encountered :)

For the oracle tutorial, they are using enums, which should only take on a limited number of values in which all of them should have a switch case, the only time that the assertion occurs is when a new enum value is added but not handled. This is a good scenario to use assertions since it indicates that the code needs to be updated. Furthermore, the switch case does not return, so presumably there will be a happy path below to handle the returning. For your example, you might want to explain the rationale behind asserting and catching that very same assertion when it can be handled all within the same else block. I would assume if the `command` is invalid, a parsing exception should either be raised like for the banana scenario since it is not to be handled by the `parseCommand` method, or there is a default `Fruit` to be returned instead.

I took a brief look at your iP code, I assume that the relevant part of your code in in `Parser.java`, namely the `Parser::parseRemainder` right? Do correct me if I am wrong. My understanding of exceptions is that it is thrown when something out of the norm has occurred, and it is something that the current method that is throwing the exception should not be able to handle. Hence throwing an exception will skip the rest of the execution and raise it through the call stack for it to be caught. If the current method can handle the issue, then an exception should not be thrown, it can be handled directly at the place where the exception is thrown. 

I understood your point of not returning a default object since there's none for this case, so throwing an exception to be caught by the call stack makes a lot of sense, since an exception during parsing indicates no valid return value, and hence the method calling `Parser::parseRemainder` ideally should catch this exception and be able to handle it, i.e. printing the error message.

(Exception throwing is quite literal, it's about throwing the problem to someone else, so I don't have to handle it)

Yup you're right, since your if-else block is the only block left, and every block returns a valid object if no exceptions raised, it should not complain anymore.

Your branch-A-Assertions share a common history as your master branch, differing only by the merge and undo commit, hence there is nothing to be merged into master. For this case, it is easier to just undo your last 2 commits and do a force push on your master branch. You might want to take reference from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22682870/git-undo-pushed-commits).

it is just a local branch named as "revert/CSmortal/branch-A-Assertions", before doing any reverts it is just a 1:1 copy of your master branch, after the revert commit if you didn't also push the local branch but only merged the revert branch, you won't be able to see the branch on the remote.

The notion of writing good code is to write readable code, and both streams and loops can do the same job.

Thanks, @SoonKeatNeo for your insights 👍 Although I am comfortable with using both, I do agree with what you mentioned that preference of one over the other is subjective.
I believe @rajobasu is somewhat right in the sense that it is about writing lesser code, and could lead to easier to manage code. Along with @Cheng20010201 who mentions that streams could be used for parallelizing and processing a large dataset.

I guess it really depends on the use then, perhaps the conventional for loops for simple functions, and streams when I know I have to handle a large amount of data.

But I was wondering from the industry standpoint, would software engineers tend to be more comfortable with loops or streams?  Is there some kind of industry preference out there if any of you guys have an internship experience.

> From the file path and where you’re running the JAR from, I think the relative path there would imply that your duke.txt file is in: `...\Java\compileroutput\artifacts\ip_jar\src\data\duke.txt`, which I guess is not what you have set up? You can verify this if you create the src\data directory in ip_jar folder.

Hi thx!
I don't have a ip_jar\src folder at all, I just went to check the jar structure and it looks like this
ip.jar
->data
->->duke.txt
->main
->->java
->->->...all classes etc
->META-INF
btw, may i clarify what do you mean by create the src\data directory in ip_jar folder?
Thx again!

<panel  header="**1. :fas-info-circle: How does IntelliJ initialize Gradle upon start up?**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S2/forum/issues/97" expanded>

Some observations I gathered while doing the Week 4 tasks:

1. Setup instructions for Gradle requires deleting `.idea` folder and reopening the project (or invalidating caches as suggested by [SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5905896/intellij-inspection-gives-cannot-resolve-symbol-but-still-compiles-code))
1. Project opening time is noticeably longer after Gradle is integrated, with the pop-up mentioning something about indexing project files
1. JavaFX libraries are automatically installed upon [addition of dependencies](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaFxPart1.html) into `build.gradle` and restart of IntelliJ IDE

My guess is IntelliJ somehow caches project information inside the `.idea` folder, which includes commands to load Gradle and its configuration files upon opening the project. Could someone perhaps point me to resources to find out more? 😃 

The fact that the IDE automatically does dependency checking and library installation without the user initiating these operations sounds a little intrusive 😢 Or maybe I'm too used to a simple text editor environment.

Same problem occurred to me as well, after specifying the JavaFX dependencies in `build.gradle`.

You could try this sequence of steps: closing the project, deleting the `.idea` folder (or alternatively selecting Invalidate Cache) and then reopening it again and let Gradle/IDE rebuild these files.

I'm assuming you're using IntelliJ here?

Jumping on the bandwagon :)

If dealing with images is too troublesome, can consider not using them at all. Went for a multi-monitor look-and-feel with an 'always-on' list, so that I can lower stress levels leaving `list` out between every command. The past commands are made clickable to make correcting wrong commands easier, by adding an `onMouseClicked` event to the individual boxes.

Good day,

I'm trying to do Level-10: GUI.
I have followed the [JavaFX tutorial](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaFx.html) for both my actual [DukeBot](https://github.com/douglaswja/ip/tree/fix-unable-to-open-display) and a [dummy one](https://github.com/douglaswja/gui-dukebot-stub) that uses a DukeBot stub, as recommended by the [Week 4 Project page](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s2.github.io/website/schedule/week4/project.html#3-add-increments-as-branches-a-gradle-a-checkstyle-level-10-a-varargs).

In both of these projects, whenever I use the command `./gradlew run` I get the following error:
![unable-to-open-display-error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27340314/107868959-e2f02880-6ec3-11eb-810e-f630b9cd2861.png)

However, in the dummy project where a stub of DukeBot was setup to support the JavaFX classes given in the tutorial, running the Launcher via Intellij works fine. (Running my full DukeBot via Intellij gives an error which I suspect might be unrelated).

Notes:
1. I looked at the [forum post about getting Intellij to build and run using Gradle](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S2/forum/issues/97) and have confirmed that my Intellij settings are the same as in the post. So it surprises my that running via Intellij works whereas running via `./gradlew run` does not.
2. I have updated my build.gradle to set the main class as the Launcher.java.
3. I have pushed both projects to github repositories so that anyone whos interested can recreate the error:
- [Branch of Full iP](https://github.com/douglaswja/ip/tree/fix-unable-to-open-display)
- [Branch of Stub DukeBot](https://github.com/douglaswja/gui-dukebot-stub)

Hi, I'm trying to do A-Gradle and I keep encountering the following problem.
![Gradle Build Error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27340314/107794580-948f3c80-6d92-11eb-8808-a47e7ff0cd7f.png)

esktop/NUS Work/Y3S2/CS2103/ip/build/resources/main}.
```

If i run `./gradlew run` my iP works fine and can be interacted with, however `./gradlew build` always fails and gives the above error.
I have searched online forums and also tried debugging my build.gradle file by using println statements, everything seems to be working fine but the error keeps appearing.

I have also compared my build.gradle against a friends whose one works and it seems to match, only differing in our file names.

I am using WSL2 and IntelliJ.

Does anyone know how to fix the above issue?
By not being able to build the project via Gradle I cannot complete A-Gradle and every subsequent task that relies on Gradle.


Notes:
1. I got the checkstyle.xml and supressions.xml from the AB-3 Github page
2. The above xml files are in the correct directory (ip/config/checkstyle)
3. The following code in build.gradle correctly points to the directory mentioned in point 2. I checked using a println statement.
```
checkstyle {
    toolVersion = '8.29'
    configFile = rootProject.file("${rootDir}/config/checkstyle/checkstyle.xml")

Hi @tjtanjin, thanks for the quick response.

In line with your suggestions I have attempted the following:
1. I removed the line in gradle.build containing `configFile = ...` however the same error occured.
2. I've looked through the [guide you uploaded on the CS2103 forum](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S2/forum/issues/93) and I'm pretty sure my steps matched those in the guide when I was setting up Gradle.
3. I've pushed my current version to [a branch in my repo called fix-gradle-unable-to-create-root-module](https://github.com/douglaswja/ip/tree/fix-gradle-unable-to-create-root-module) for any kind person whos willing to take a look.

I have already done that. The issue persisted. I have also redownloaded the Intellij application, did not fix the issue either.

Hi I'm encountering NullPointerException when running Duke so I narrowed down and realized its my ui when running in a duke.run(). If it simply runs outside of the duke.run() it works fine. I'm not sure why is this so. First picture is my Duke.java, second picture is the error occurred and third is the write up of my Ui.java. Thanks in advance!

Hi guys newbie here. My source tree was looking good but as I was looking to rename my commits I did some rebase commands and in the end now my source tree is a mess :( The pink branch was my main branch but now it does not have a "branch" to it. How do I move my master to the commit of A-more OOP? Thanks in advance!

I think it may have to do with `System.lineSeparator()` as line separators differ from operating system to operating system. You should be able to toggle the lineSeparator in IntelliJ on the bottom tool bar from a label that says either LF/CR/CRLF. But it might be better to not use `System.lineSeparator()`.

From my understanding, the `finally` block is used for resource releasing. As in although Java has a garbage collector, there are still some classes/objects you'll have to manually close, such as files. So if you opened a file in a `try` block, you'll have close it in the `finally` block, because the `finally` block would execute regardless.

Some checkstyle files have syntax errors or version incompatibility, not sure which. But most of them are issues with `TreeWalker`. Edit the xml file and move the modules in the warnings out of `TreeWalker` one by one.

Like for this screenshot, you'll want to move the entire `FileContentsHolder` module out of `TreeWalker`.

Just move them warning by warning. I don't think there are that many of them.

Personally, I feel that if the chaining of stream methods are properly line skipped looks cleaner as compared to loops as loops increase indentation levels and as the indentation levels goes up, the code becomes more unreadable. So for me, I use streams to replace small loops in order to increase code readability.

Is that all there is in your Duke.java? I think you'll need a Duke constructor where you define your Ui, Storage, as attributes of the Duke object (as in the example provided in the project week2 page)

A workaround (while you are waiting for a reply/figuring out the solution) can be:
instead of using
`private Image user = new Image(this.getClass().getResourceAsStream("/images/DaUser.png"));`
you can use
`private Image user = new Image("file:./pathToFileFromRootDirectory/DaUser.png")`
you may need to handle cross platform `/` or `\` though if you do this.

From what I see from reading the [Checkstyle documentation](https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/config_naming.html), it doesn't look like its very possible unless you write? your own module for checkstyle. I don't think there's a module in checkstyle that applies specifically only to final variables.

I suppose you could include a Regexp module to check for final variables, but it does seem quite overkill. Also, not sure how overlapping modules work.

Anyway, I believe this is a case of where a discrepancy exists between coding standards and the given `checkstyle.xml`, since as you pointed out, you will violate both `AbbreviationAsWordInName` and `MemberName` if you rename the final (nonstatic) variable to SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE. From what prof mentioned in [the issue you raised previously on final variables](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S2/forum/issues/98#issuecomment-771352035), I believe we will not be faulted if we do not use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for final (nonstatic) variables.

Prof @damithc, In line with this, can we use Maven to manage the dependencies?

Perhaps I am misunderstanding something, allow me to clarify my thought process:
As Jackson is a 3rd party dependency, there are 2 ways to manage it.

- we can add it to the classpath manually
- we can use a package manager to manage our dependencies

From my understanding, Gradle is meant for build automation, but Maven is meant to do dependency management (Perhaps I am wrong about this)

With that reasoning in mind, I asked if we should use Maven to manage Jackson, so that version updates etc can be quickly and easily taken care of by updating the pom.xml file. However, if Gradle can do this as well, then it would make more sense to use Gradle as the project is already intending to use it down the road.

Do let me know if this makes sense 😅

Hi, can you try typing `where java` in your terminal. It shows the location of your current java installations in your computer. If you see more than 1 location, it might be that you are using one of your older version (java 8) to run your runtest.bat file.

I believe that your current Java path in your environment variable is pointing to Java 8. Can you replace that path with your java 11 path (you can use the directory given in the `where java` command) and try to run your runtest.bat file again?

I used enums for the commands and a switch statement in the main method. For the enum class, I used a [constructor for the enum constants](https://dzone.com/articles/usage-enumeration-enum-java#:~:text=We%20use%20Enum%20for%20a,final%20keywords%20to%20represent%20constants.&text=We%20can%20define%20values%20for,field%20variable%20for%20this%20enum.) to give them a String value. This is so that I can relate the enum commands to the commands inputted by the user.
e.g. `TODO("todo")`
However since the commands in my main were of String type, I converted them to the enum type using a [lookup method](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1080904/how-can-i-lookup-a-java-enum-from-its-string-value) and only after that pass the commands into a switch statement.

@chesterhow I agree, it does seem quite verbose to have additional manipulation to support the enum type. But I think some possible benefits enum could have over stacking `static final` constants in main is that it provides better readability, and added functionality (enum methods).

But once again, running Gradle's `verficiation/test` works and passes my testcase just fine.

Is this a cause for concern, because my code is literally the same and yet these error that are not present before are here suddenly.

Yes, I'm using Gradle as the default for both `build and run` and `run tests`.

Yes! my `mainClassName` is "Launcher", and I've been trying to run  using the Launcher `main()` method haha
What I'm confused is that the error says `Location is not set`, and yes when I tried  to `System.out.println(Main.class.getResource("/view/MainWindow.fxml"))` I get a `null`, and hence I'm really confused since Gradle should be using the same code (and the tutorial literally works before with the same code) and yet for some reason my IDE is popping up all these errors now haha

oh my god. What the... IT WORKS
Thank you so much sir...
But actually what does marking the folder as `Resource Root` does ah out of curiousity? And why can Gradle run it fine, but the IDE doesnt seem to know it's a resource folder?

Also really ,thanks, but my tests are still goners though... This is my screenshot of my folder structure just in case I didn't mark it again...

I'm not sure actually. My project team helped me to test out my duke.jar file and seems like it works well in Mac and Linux.
However, the error sometimes happens on windows. I tried to run it as administrator, but it doesn't help 🙁.

If this is the case? Should I just release my jar file?

Thanks for your reply.

Faced this problem, realised that gradle refuses to use the java version specified in the project settings. 

As what Gokul has mentioned, you can also check if your java version is actually defaulted to 11 in terminal.
`java -version`

I solved by doing the following:
1) Removed all java jdks on mac
`sudo rm -rf /Library/Java/*`

2) Remove all java jdks in this folder
Library>Java>JavaVirtualMachines

3) Reinstall jdk11 from oracle

4) Rebuild gradle and create jar file 

Hope this helps anyone facing the same issue!

To add on, when you run the Duke.java (or your Main java file) in Intellij, the .class files are generated and stored in the bin directory. This directory is not committed because it's excluded in the .gitignore file. So you could consider adding `/src/main/java/*.class` to your .gitignore file to exclude the .class files.

Hi, I tried cloning your repo and running it locally (also windows) and it's working fine for me. This could mean that your system is blocking access to  `duke.txt` after the first run for some reason.&gt;br>

I've tried to follow the instruction and create a new module test from an existing source. But somehow I still having trouble importing duke. Duke. There is no dependencies tab for the test module and when I add reference of Duke in DukeTest, the hint has suggested moving duke. Duke into test/java/duke instead of creating dependencies. Did I miss out on some steps in the instructions or is there something wrong with my setup in the IntelliJ.

> You might want to try unmarking your `src` folder as `Sources Root` and then marking the `java` folder within your `main` folder as `Sources Root` first. Then, check if the directory structure in your `java` file in the `main` folder mirrors that of the `java` file inside your `test` folder. You shouldn't have to explicitly import `Duke` in your test class. Use `Duke` in the test class as you would normally in the main class and a prompt would pop up for you again to rectify the error. See if any of the above helps :D

Correct me if I'm wrong: even when returning or printing strings for an error message e.g `return "Oops, the program encountered some error and this is the error message.";` this is considered a magic literal and should be replaced with `return ERROR_MESSAGE_SPECIFICATION;`

However, I'm not sure if we just want to return something like `return "added: " + eventAdded + " to some list.";` is this considered magic literal and affecting the code quality?

This was covered a while ago in Week 2 readings, but it has only become a question now.
Might there be a case where we must have a "finally" block,
in other words, a case where we cannot just go out of the try-catch blocks?

I've been running my code on IntelliJ, which gives rise to a bug I cannot solve. (only the 1st line includes the desired effect of "head: " appended at the front.
On running my code in Ubuntu, after compiling and running "java Duke", the result it different; it works.
Any idea why this happens?
Does this mean there's something wrong with the IntelliJ terminal?


I am running respond("hi\n" + "bye\n").
```java
public static void respond(String response) {
        System.out.print(Arrays.stream(response.split(System.lineSeparator())).map(line -&gt; "head: " + line).collect(Collectors.joining("\n")));
    }
```
I'm trying to format my responses, with this method respond(String response),
which is intended to help edit any string to the format I want, so it looks better.

> From my understanding, the `finally` block is used for resource releasing. As in although Java has a garbage collector, there are still some classes/objects you'll have to manually close, such as files. So if you opened a file in a `try` block, you'll have close it in the `finally` block, because the `finally` block would execute regardless.

Thank you for your response, I am learning new things, like about garbage collecting I had no idea was related.

But if Im not failing to get something, I still think my question remains: 
is 'finally' block any different from putting its codes outside the try-catch block?
i.e. why can't we just close the file outside the entire 'try-catch' block
And to which, I think I have some idea now. 

> But finally is useful for more than just exception handling — it allows the programmer to avoid having cleanup code accidentally bypassed by a return, continue, or break.

I have resolved the issue, it's because I did not install packages such as jdk11 or dos2unix under my WSL but only on Windows. Some learning points for people who might also face such issues under WSL:

If the output says command not found, navigate to that specific line and run that command in your WSL to see what is the issue. Most of the time the system will tell you where to look for solutions.

<panel  header="**1. :fas-info-circle: Best practice for unit testing of classes**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S2/forum/issues/43" expanded>

In topic W3.6c about unit testing, the following skeleton is provided.

```
class FooTest {
    
    @Test
    void read() {
        // a unit test for Foo#read() method
    }
    
    @Test
    void write_emptyInput_exceptionThrown() {
        // a unit tests for Foo#write(String) method
    }  
    
    @Test
    void write_normalInput_writtenCorrectly() {
        // another unit tests for Foo#write(String) method
    }
}
```

In the case where there isn't much set-up required for initializing `Foo` objects, it is trivial to instantiate a new object in each test method. However, if there is a lot of set-up involved (ie population of multiple attributes of `Foo` via setter methods before the object is in a minimal state for testing), then it would be tedious to repeat the process in every method.

What would be the best practice in such a scenario? Would it be appropriate to create a method within `FooTest` that returns this properly instantiated `Foo` object or are there other best practice/conventions?

Thank you!! I got it to work! Apparently the issue was my formatting of the table was not constant (i.e. some rows have | at the start and the end, some didn't) and I did not have the new line before it, for the images, the relative path solved the issue.

Did anyone encounter InvocationTargetException and NullPointerException during the integration of JavaFX into the project?

Apparently, the error happens when I entered something like "todo book" into the textbox. I suspect it is due to the first spacing of the string.

Hello everyone!

Just wanted to highlight a possible typo while I was reading the CS2103/T online textbook.
In the _Polymorphism_ section of the _Supplementary: C++ to Java_ chapter, the ```Cat``` and ```Dog``` classes in the ```PetShelter``` example seem to miss the ```extends``` keyword.

While it is a small typo, the Java file will not compile due to the calls of the ```super``` constructor in both classes.

Thank you.

> In that case I think those two classes are not supposed to have extends Animal as this code is supposed to illustrate the situation before applying polymorphism? Or did I misunderstand your bug report?

Oh right, it could be. But if that was the case, then the ```super``` calls in the constructors of ```Cat``` and ```Dog``` would raise a compile-time error when trying to compile these classes.

I second what @w2vgd has said. `break` allows your program to break out of the switch block, while `return` allows your program to break out of the method call. Choosing one of them will do!

For those who use SceneBuilder, here's what worked for me:

In the DialogBox.fxml file, we can set the size of the Label element (found under Layout on the right pane) to the settings as follows. I believe this is similar to what @swayongshen has mentioned, by not fixing the height/width.

@Yihe-Harry  My Teammate had a similar issue. Try going to your project folder and run `./gradlew run -version`. Ensure that the JVM version is 11.+. Mine looks like this.

If it is not, it is probably because your Mac has multiple versions of Java. One easy way to fix this is to Uninstall all java versions and install java 11.

From my perspective, this increment means we should make our code as OOP as possible. Thus I think it would be a good practice to try to refactor your code to make it fits the OOP principle more. Although during this process, you may found that FP is useful for some parts of your code and you applied FP, OOP is still the bigger idea and you can just tag it `A-MoreOOP` after you are done refactoring your code. Hope this helps.

I thought of using enums for the commands too, but as @JonahhGohh mentioned, the commands were of String type and some additional manipulation was required before using them in a switch statement. This seems to be more verbose and tedious as compared to simply using `static final` constants.

I can't help but wonder if there's any benefit to using enums in this scenario instead of constants. Any thoughts? 🤔

I used enums for the commands as well, but also had to do some manipulation to get the enum constant. I converted the input string to uppercase and used the `Enum.valueOf()` method to get the corresponding enum constant, catching the IllegalArgumentException that is thrown if the command is not valid. This had the added advantage of allowing the commands to be case insensitive.

Hi guys,
I am not sure if I am doing the right way of running javac *.java and commiting all the .class file. I do not commit everytime I compile, only the time when I finalized with doing a task. From what I see now, it looks quite okay, but if say, we are going to implement more classes in the future, there would be too many stuffs within a certain directory. Is this considered as a 'right' way or a bad practice? What are your thoughts on this?

Referring to the image above and the quoted text, it says to follow the same steps I did to ignore an unstaged file. However, in SourceTree, upon right-clicking the ".gitignore" file, there is no option to "Ignore" the file itself.

Hi,

I have merged `branch-Level-8` after `branch-Level-7` into the master. However, some of my `Level-8` changes result in `Level-7` changes to fail. Hence, after the merge commit of `branch-Level-8`, my code will not run due to errors. Should I still tag the merge commit of `branch-Level-8` as `Level-8` or should I tag the commit where I fix all the errors?

Here is the instruction from the module website.

for my storage class, it loads the data file from memory directly and then returned the taskList from the data and so I use ```taskList = storage.load();```. 

I think line 2, ```storage.load(taskList);``` works by first loading the dataList onto an arrayList, perhaps by using another class like parser, and then ```storage.load(taskList)``` loads the taskList into duke's tasklist. 

I think that the first way is more convenient, but both ways are valid and your implementation depends on your definition of storage, i.e is storage suppose to load the data from memory into duke or is storage loading the data already in duke to its tasklist.

Nothing fancy here but a suggestion for anyone still struggling: try using ".png" files instead of ".jpg" files as images. 

It was the major problem I faced when class.getResourceAsStream() kept throwing null pointer exception saying the input stream was null when I used ".jpg" images even though it could read the ".fxml" files just fine...

<panel  header="**1. :fas-info-circle: A-MoreOOP: Can Ui be an interface instead of a class?**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S2/forum/issues/54" expanded>

Hi, it seems to me that the Ui might be appropriate as an interface which can then be implemented now with a TextUI and later as a GUI. I am opening this thread for two reasons:

1. to ask the teaching team if it is acceptable to define Ui as an interface instead of a class
2. to get other opinions on this subject

I considered a (possibly abstract) base class but it seems like a GUI and a text UI (TUI) might use fundamentally different mechanisms (and hence different member variables) to display stuff hence they largely only have method signatures in common. At this point, using an interface seems more appropriate than a base class. Any thoughts?

I have already tagged my commits before pushing them to my remote repo. All of my commits are all up on github, but in the ip progress dashboard, it says that all of my tags are not found in the fork. may I know I did something wrong or why my tags were not pushed for some reason?

I am facing this issue whereby the fx:controller of AnchorPane in MainWindow.fxml is unable to detect the controller class that is in the Controllers package as seen in the picture above. When I hover over the error, it says class/package cannot be resolved.

Am I navigating the package/file wrongly? Is there a specific way to use a controller?

Thank you!

Hi Prof, what if we implemented the extensions directly in each level so they are in the same commit?

Initially, I thought of using enums for easy iteration as well, but it still presents the problem of poor readability ( I really don't like the long switch/if-else statements presented as we added more and more keywords ). I opted for using a HashMap instead and eventually led to using the [Command Pattern](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s2.github.io/website/se-book-adapted/chapters/designPatterns.html#command-pattern) presented in the book.

Thanks for the suggestion! However, personally, using HBox did not work for me 

I managed to get things working by adding `dialog.setMinHeight(Region.USE_PREF_SIZE)` in the constructor of DialogBox, as per the second answer here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35012518/resize-javafx-label-if-overrun

Hi, "Issues are a great way to keep track of tasks, enhancements, and bugs for your projects. They're kind of like email—except they can be shared and discussed with the rest of your team. Most software projects have a bug tracker of some kind. GitHub's tracker is called Issues, and has its own section in every repository."
Since no one reported a bug or found any issues in your code so it is totally fine that is empty.

```java
import java.util.regex.Matcher;
import java.util.regex.Pattern;

Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
String line = sc.nextLine();

Pattern p = Pattern.compile("^(\\S+)\\s(.*)$");
Matcher m = p.matcher(line);
if (m.find()) {
  System.out.println(m.group(1));
  System.out.println(m.group(2));
};

// Works for this primitive test case

Using `Pattern` and `Matcher` does work, although solutions such as the one given by @tjtanjin seem to be more succinct :)
